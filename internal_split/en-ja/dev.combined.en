I think having something run that long would be a neat accomplishment, something that you create to exist long past your time.
I do. I used to play a lot but not any more. Do you play too?
did you throw your order into a wooden trunk?
Wow that is hard to believe although I have been on that ride and it is so much fun. The dinosaurs in Jurassic Park only appear in the film for 15 minutes surprisingly. It was nice talking with you today.
Wow that's impressive! Did you realize that airplanes travel 10% slower these days? They do it to save fuel but you also get to your destination slower
no, not a big gamer, you? The u.s. department of defense used 1760 playstation 3's to build a supercomputer because it was cheaper than the alternative
True but I think cats are smarter than most politicians. Can you see your average House member doing long division?
That is really expensive I agree, did you watch the Lego Batman movie?
you see I liked Force Awakens a lot. I like Kylo Ren. its a different spin because he conflicted and not just all big bad and evil
Honestly, it would hurt to throw a phone as high as you could, and even to attempt to catch it with your hands. Needs some setup. Avoiding hitting yourself in the face.

Minerva.  Her name is actually Minerva Mouse.  I think Minnie suits her much better don't you?
I never thought about that. Could you imagine washing your clothes in old faithful?
I didn't until you just told me!  Lego replaced Ferrari as the worlds most powerful brand in 2015.
Yep I agree it seems stupid. I don't know why they need to play on grass specifically, did you hear about the longest tennis point of all time?

LOL. Well, it wasn't designed for tourists! I guess you learned your lesson. Still, thanks for helping keep Istanbul clean!
Since Nintendo owns the Mariners there;s even a 3DS app that allows you to order food direct to your seat. That would be awesome!

That's a safer translation. Well, I enjoyed chatting with you! Enjoy your Bible study!
I guess the instrument would irritate your face over a long time period. Do you enjoy fantasy by any chance?
Yes they do, tipping your hat origin is from when a knight raises their visors.
Hmm. Do you hunt? Or are the deer protected in your area? There are lots of places that restrict such things.

Yes, your height is great for corner kicks. maybe as a goalie too. Anyway, great chat!
I thought it was great too! It really surprised me that it was so good!  It's also impressive about that super computer don't you think?
That is pretty funny. It must be out of principle because they definitely have the money, only $30,000, I guess they just don't want to support it perhaps? What do you think

I know, and when you think about it it doesnt take much time just have to incorporate them as habits in your routine.
Good Morning! Do you like to watch horror films?
