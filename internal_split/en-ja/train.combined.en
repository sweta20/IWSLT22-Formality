Now, you're talking more my speed...LOL. Yes, I liked the Jungle Book as well as more of the Walt Disney pictures.
He's probably losing it a bit to be honest. It wouldn't surprise me.
Yes me as well! Apparently 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern day shoes. I want to know how they found that out.
I love Tywin Lannister actually LOL I think Daenerys is kind of boring personally but that's just me, I also like the little finger but he's dead now LOL
ya it must be, do you have a shoe collection by the way, I myself only have about 4 pairs
I have not, its on my to do list lol I love animal shows too.
Me too, the homecoming series has been my favorite of the bunch. I would love to see a Peter Parker and Tony Stark movie where they both are unaware of their special powers.
maybe they should shorten it to like socball lol sounds better to me.
Yeah, there's no failsafe if your flying car breaks down and you plummet to your death. It would be cool to fly an Uber to my Cricket game. I think I'd look cool landing on the pitch.
So how do you feel about snakes? I have a pet king snake myself, and I love them.
wow, mine was 2 weeks from the fair lol! It was so nice chatting with you!
That's the same with me. I comment very little. I didn't realize Facebook is blue because Zuckerburg is red-green colorblind...
Hey what's up do use Google very often?I really love the company and was surprised to hear that it was founded back in 1998.
Yes mine hurts just thinking about it. Edgar Allan Poe is another classic poet and he only received $9 for the publication of his poem the Raven.
I think it is, I try to reward my kids efforts that seems to work with me, I also try to limit their social media use among other things.
I know and that cartoon practically took over my life.
There has been the odd rap song that I like, but for me it's cultural. I'm just not from the environment most rappers are and can't appreciate their point of view.
I am a guitarist. I love playing my guitar. I only play when I am ready for open mic or recording music.
For sure, my wife is from brazil and i have to correct myself all the time talking about american football with them!
Indeed he doesn't. But I've always liked Chewbacca because he reminded me of a giant dog. Ha! Speaking of dogs, I think it's cool that dogs, along with elephants, are the only animals that understand pointing!
I guess you(me) really do learn something new everyday! In case this chat ends unexpectedly, it was really great chatting with you today!
ya that makes me really sad, what do you think about fish? I had salmon for dinner so I do think theyre tasty haha
Of course - a little before my time, but very influential in the Rock/Punk Rock scene. Ramones kinda started the live rock scene in NYC - or at least were the kings of it for some time
Yes, that is something that really makes me worried for the human being. I get it, is something that is going to happen, and we are contributing to that, but, I hope our grandkids still can get a good job.
Yeah. I don't remember Google going down for 5 minutes in 2013. It took 40% of web traffic with it. I probably thought it was a problem on my end.
LOL... yeah? maybe they can debone my chicken?
I thought I heard about Elon Musk in Inception, but I cannot recall what character he played?  I've seen that movie several times to try to understand it!
yeah! it was founded back in 1923 and it is definitely approaching 100 years. That seems really insane to me
Our dogs lay between my spouse and I. They are our buffer zone. My husband used to wake up being mad at me, but now he can't be made because they are so sweetly laying there.
Im surprised that it is that high. i figured 1 percent maybe. i dont usually read them myself.
do you have a smart speaker? I have an alexa... but they kind of creep me out sometimes.
Really??? I wish mine did. Which games? I bet not GTA 5. Speaking of teenagers, a Malawian teenager taught himself how to build a watermill out of junk to power his village.
Yeah I didn't spend my time in college trying to make companies either, I wish I did though.
Apparently, 80 percent of the earth's natural forests have already been destroyed. It's depressing to me.
It has, my favorite pop song is We Are the Champions and its actually voted as the catchiest song by a group of scientists
Yes, me too. I like to listen to jazz from time to time. There;'s even a woman in Harlem that has held free jazz concerts at her apartment every Saturday for 20 years.
I remember thinking just about everything in the prequels' timeline was off, based on the mental version of the past the OT led us to construct. But I'd have to rewatch to nail it down.
That makes total sense to me! I feel like we are spoiled when it comes to the sun's energy!
I guess he's ok but he's not my favorite. But I am also an adult haha. I guess that during World War II he took a break from kids books and did some political stuff, I never knew that
I agree! The Marvel cinematic universe takes place in earth -199999, a multiverse different from the original comic book multiverse, earth-616!
Small ones dont bother me but once they get past a certain size thats a big nope from me. Roaches freak me out.
I think 2 was my favorite though i liked them all. 1 & 2 were the best for me. Kinda went down hill after that.
I have not heard that. I know that comic book legend Stan Lee used to end every phone conversation with "excelsior!"
That is really crazy what a lucky guy! It would be cool to be the first person to get a picture taken, what do you think about traveling by the way? I just got back from Florida myself
Yes Earth has been around for a long time for sure. So interesting to me is that Earth is about 71% covered with water. The other 29% is land and various Islands.
Hi, thats good,  some places make spaghetti and meatballs as party food, that seems odd to me
Hahaaha, me neither. Well, I am surprised that crocodiles are closer related to birds than snakes and lizards, I donÂ´t think they resemble a bird, cool
Yeah!  I was wrong... It was Musk's wife that was in Inception.  I have no idea what she looks like.  Nolan got his son in the movie too.
I mean - I think it is definitely music...but I agree not my type.
Yeah I would like to know that myself. There is even a planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500 mph! Sounds like a warzone over there!
It would surprise me. What do you think of Tom Cruise?
Sonic in a rock band? I guess he has the haircut for it. He could probably have joined Whitesnake.
That would be a few free ones for me and I do love my whoppers!
I listen to an easy listening station on my commute, to and from work. I try to keep myself calm, the traffic where I live is horrible.
That's strange - makes me wonder if you play a concert for no audience - is it really a concert?
Hmm, it wouldn't surprise me. Hawking went further than Einstein did on understanding of gravity. Hawking developed new graphical methods that let him visualize physics of light paths in warped space, black holes, and the convulsions of the universe.
Beauty and the Beast is my wife's favorite.  Mine is Lion King.  Do you have a favorite Disney movie?
I figure I could plan ahead. Maybe a long weekend. That would give me time to digest.
I have! It was great! The huge amount of dragonflies last summer reminded me of that movie lol
Yes, it is such a good idea. I try to feed mine by hand as well as any local strays near my home
it blows my mind to think about it! We truly are just so tiny in comparison to everything else
I don't know sounds kind of creepy to me! Almost like the work of fiction! Like something from someones imagination!
Yes I think that Polo shirts were invented for tennis players. I like polo shirts myself, do you?
I have a rule similar to that in my house...lol
Really? I bet that was wild. I didn't think I'd ever need to know much about it myself. We were actually talking about Wayne Rooney a little bit ago.
Me neither. I could never be a professional dancer.
Probably not although it is just fascinating to me how that journey has changed since USA planted its flag on the moon.
Haha me too, got to learn to skate first. I am going to take off though, great chatting with you.
I did but I didn't really play it all that much, my brothers did though.
That's funny because he was very tall. He kept his important documents inside his hat. I guess that hat was pretty big.
Yeah, but, to me that is pretty good improvisation for whoever came with that idea.
It wasn't that big. I kept bringing it to school so my parents made me get rid of it. It was an albino ball python. I could put it in my pocket. LOL
If I'm watching a movie at home I don't care about the reviews as much but definitely want to make sure I am getting my moneys worth at the theater.
your guess is as good as mine! im going to go look into that. Nice chatting with you!
Didn't see the Last Samurai.  I heard they were making a TG sequel - wonder how that will be received?
I like taking my kids to see scary movies because then they are more willing to go to the art museum with me and enjoy it.
ya that is interesting, it's scary to me that we wilsl run out of helium by the end of this century, I know that it's very important for manufacturing electronics
I also love animals, I have a dog, but Ive been asking my husband for a dragon for years
Do you apologize to your dog when you accidentally trip over him? I do. I even find myself saying "excuse me" sometimes to my dogs! LOL!
Yes indeed, interesting facts that will give me pause this weekend. That was an enjoyable conversation. Thanks and have a lovely weekend.
I've been there, it's not cool in my opinimust have a lot of borinrse everywhere and I'm allergic to horses so it was horrible for me LOL
I was in high school when that came out. I remember sitting in my friend's muscle car in the morning before class drinking Southern Comfort while it played on the radio, LOL.
The writing was great, yes. Chris Pratt and April made the show for me. Happy dog and angry cat!
Yeah PlayStation 2 is my favorite! And speaking of PlayStation threes, apparently they were being used to research black holes because they were so powerful
I heard that Ireland finances the Game of Throne series because it's filmed there and they get a good boost of tourism through that. Sounds good to me!
The name Uranus always makes me laugh haha. I wish that we had another planet in our solar system no. Jupiter's moon Ganymede could actually be considered a planet if it orbited the Sun instead of being a moon
Yeah too much pc is lame for me, to me you should be able to create whatever content you want and if its bad then its bad and people wont like it because it sucks.
I am not sure, how do they do this?
Haha. Funny. I don't eat seafood. My mom forced me to eat salmon way too often when I was little and I grew sick of it. Haha #firstworldproblems.
With me being of African decent myself. I consider myself as a oral historian or praise singer
Ah, that's too bad haha. But unlike romance novels, I can't stay myself. But I had nice chat and I hope you have a nice day. Goodbye!
Yeah that would be a lot of fun. I didn't realize that cats sleep so much. Must be nice.
How interesting! Have you watched Game of Lions? Maybe that would interest me more because it is about the lives of lions.
Yeah when you think about how basic that system was compared to what they have today. I think ps3 will last a long time though just because it will play blurays. that is about all I use mine for anymore.
OH my lord, when it sped up I got so anxious and you could basically bet I was going to lose wihtin a few pieces. The other day I was thinking about spy hunter. Did you ever play that game?
I've never used it, it is hilarious, because I have an iphone. I don't have alexa, I'm scared it will spy on me.
No, the only bird I ever cook is chicken; I'm looking to expand my skillset, though! They're the most numerically successful class of tetrapods.
I believe Serena has been at the top of her peers about 319 weeks. (Please hit done as my button is not working).
That crossed my mind too.  A monkey would be of concern for me too.  Eventually a line has to be draw.
it was a poor choice yes. and the way they showed Luke was not to my liking either...
Haha He would have my vote too! I didn't know not all men in the uk could vote until 1918!
I agree! What kind of music do you like to listen to?
Probably to keep traffic down. That's my guess anyway. At least they're not like Makinac Island where they don't allow any cars at all. That's some serious traffic control.
Yeah. I always tell my wife that if she ever leaves, I am going with so don't get any ideas. I say that because I am never dating again. I supervise 30 millenials and their dating habits confuse me.
I believe it. those shoes look dainty. i would probably go through a dozen myself. LOL
But Roger is good looking so that would be nice. If my face were on a stamp, then yes, get me cows.
1 mb of RAM. Well if I had a memory, it would be forget only access, or 1 mb of FOA. Apple tells me that my warranty is void because of a bio hazard.
Nice chatting with you too, I think I'm gonna try to look for old baseball cards in my attic
haha or me when I'm hungry haha, what I do want is to put a flame thower on my car like you can in South Africa
I didn't know that. I wonder how many people use it. By comparison to Japan, the US comic book market in the US and Canada is $1.09 billion!
What? Really? That's insane! But then again I work on designing quantum computers  so I've seen some weird stuff myself haha. Physics is weird in general, don't you think?
He was an exceptional player, but he doesn't strike me as someone who was quick on his feet. New York should be able to forgive him
Hmm, sounds familiar but I haven't. Is it sci-fi? I love to read and have done some writing myself, including sci-fi.
That's a throw back! I wanted to like that game so much but my friends were so much better than me so I decided to hate those games...
Will Smith and Brat Pitt are the ones that declined the role, and yeah I bet they though it was going to be a lousy movie.
I don't know but tom hanks played walt disney in that movie apparently, I've never seen it myself
You would think but that's not what they pay me for, ha. Maybe we should move to new zealand they don't have snakes there.
Generally not. I'm originally from the UK so I guess most people would associate me with a bowler hat, but never really worn any type of hat.
I have checked to see if my info is being used by some sites. but i dont look for myself. You?
Yeah me too. It is the second largest search engine now on the internet
I learned Italian and French in school and am teaching myself Italian.  I love languages.
I'm guessing that is because of TV and movies, we get this idea of the way it is shown when reality is somewhat different. Being self deprecating, I'd say a dunces cap suits me well.
That makes me wonder how many miles the goats Google used to trim their grass traveled. Maybe 15 miles?
I know they steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. When I get a spider web on me, I freak out lol.
me too. I heard they might be setting it up to have it be loki pretending to be the hulk. That would be an amazing twist.
I know, Also, I do believe in Japan there is less people under 15 years of age than pets.
They made him seem like he regressed into some kind of whiney baby, at his age and experience he should be evolving more like Ben Kenobi or even Yoda, not woah is me I need a xanex Luke
ok, yes that's what I read... and somebody needs to explain to me, how using a surrogate really works...
I think that he is a great actor, Ive always thought he had mad skills and think its kind of dangerous him doing his own stunts
Yeah that is strange to me. They now are streaming comedy also
Yes. They are into video games now (too much if you ask me). It's been fun talking ball with you! I enjoyed it. Have a good day!
Yeah totally fake indeed, What I do like about the movie is the different locations, Paris, London, Kashmir.
Me too, although its hard to rest for me these days I have twins, they keep going and going haha I spend a lot of time on the internet.
I haven't heard of that game, either. There's a game I play where you get better by doing daily tasks. I should make an AI device to do it for me!
yes me too. some of them can eat prey twice their sizew
The fate of the Dodo always makes my wife cry.  They appear to have been so trusting, which is what to their demise.
Yeah me too but it sounds like they used to use animals more. Truman seem to take that very seriously especially at Disneyland.
lol, me either.  I saw that there was a breed of Jellyfish that is immortal.  I wish I was, lol.
I know thats amazing. That would be really nice, my relatives dont collect anything cool like that so Im on my own lol
I would like to. it got good reviews. Anyway, great chat!
Only if my team (Knicks) have a chance at the postseason, which is mostly no. I think they have a worse record than James Naismith's University of Kansas teams
Yes my thoughts precisely. Well at least we are prepared. The UN has a contingency plan just in case!
Yes I know a lot of computer languages as well but my degree was in math!   I did not know Serena was a co-owner of the Miami Dolphins!
yea I wish we had single payer, my health insurance is so complicated sometimes. people shouldnt go broke over a doctor visit
Yes I'm not either.  Must be nice to make that kind of money.
While I'm a pet owner, that going a bit far. Do you give dogs and cats rights, how about those dairy cows or cattle to be eaten. Do they get lesser rights?
Yeah! He was the mouse king in the Nutcracker. Thats pretty cool, I would definitely never have guessed that about him.
I write poetry myself.  And I have read the poem that is depressing reading forward yet inspiring when read backwards, it was all over facebook.
That is definitely sad and very troubling. It makes me wonder what will happen to the polar regions with all of the ice.
I agree! Look...I love my sleep but there are some birds who fly from alaska to northern mexico without sleeping when migrating. Exhausting!
I dunno because my friend told me that the women's world cup had higher television ratings than the world series.
On my phone it's Google like you. On my laptop it's Cortana by I don't use it much.  I didn't know there was a male Siri -- a British guy?
Me too and my toddler is addicted to it which I don't think is good. Justin Bieber's baby song is the most disliked video on youtube? how crazy is that? I though young people love Bieber
Well, President of the United States, I wonder if he had them in the White House? Did he have a stable for the bear out back?
Me too. He doesn't say sorry to me, though, when he tries to push me out of bed at night. My other little dog hugs my arm while I am sleeping.
I would become wonder why though it gwonder why though.
Yes! That is really my thought too. We need a president who has a very good head on their shoulders. How awesome would that be!
Hey, you're never too old.  I'm a grandparent myself! Lol I did see Big Hero 6 with my grandsons and it's a good little cartoon movie.  Fantastic graphics it was made using a 55,000 core supercomputer.
Yeah me too. It seems like they just care about making money. Do you like dancing? I don't very much but Bruce Lee was apparently a great dancer and was a champion dancer in 1958.
I really love to cook. Thanksgiving in my favorite holiday to cook for. Planning the meal and making everything fit on my oven is like tetris.
I can play some, I have an electric piano that I keep plugged in in my room.
None. I am pretty sure federer could have hit me in the head with a tennis ball on his serve and I would not have known about the serve for a few minutes...
Yeah, that made me a little hungry. Did you like Michael Jackson?
I know I was shocked the day that I left Wendy's and my phone asked me how my visit was! My daughter laughed so hard.
Reminds me of the Matrix, where he downloads information into his brain and is instantly an expert. I'd rather take my time and be entertained and relaxed!
I'm a dog lover myself. I love that Istanbul has vending machines for stray dogs to get water and encourages recycling at the same time. Seems like we are slacking a bit here in the U.S
I agree, movies are becoming unrealistic like that, they have become too scaled, irrational.
YES ;) mine too. That vocal was amazing ! ;) was... such a shame...
Well me personally. I would rather watch third rock any day. Those other shows were quite popular in their day though.
lol :) my dogs actually get off the bed by themselves because they are getting to warm and they love the cold :) lucky me ! :)
Tell me about it apparently there are more U.S. Tigers living as pets than there are living in the wild in Asia.
I don't have a fear of snakes, but spiders on the other hand I almost can not stand them to even be near me, hate the little buggers.
If I was a better cinematographer, I'd make my own movies, but thats not in the cards. Its been nice visiting with you.
Haha! You sound like me. I do watch certain TV shows when I can. Me and my dog sit on the sofa and veg out lol....we like the travel channel sometimes.
Yes. I mostly like the artwork on the cards. It's definitely better than watching the World Series baseball. I think my Grandpa used to call it the Fall Classic or something.
Not really. I'm a homebody. But from my chair, the internet can take me just about anywhere. Are you a traveler?
He is pretty new to me as well.  I heard he was big in the development of Reagan's Presidential Library.
That's crazy, my computer is fairly new but I have no idea how many gigs it has!
lol, I know, I guess the US have more tigers as pets than living wild in Asia.
I was just thinking the same thing, When you asked me about costumes, he came to mind.  I really do like Spiderman as well.
Hi there! Would you mind sharing with me, your political orientation? Personally, I call myself an independent. But I'd kind of prefer the term unaffiliated.
I used to have a collie named Bimbo. That's a great question.
Yeah i generally get music from there but if i'm stuck on something like fixing my car or computer then it's good to have.
No I haven't but I did go to Universal studios back in the late 90s and went to the Terminator 3D show, wow I was blown away!! How was the ride?
Me too, I love xbox, I great up with playstation then got my first xbox 360 after! Even though it red ringed, I still loved it!
Awesome me too. I love that they were inspired by the works of Poe, Stoker, and Shelley.
They used to make me mad but I didn't use my anger positively like that. Now Netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth between 9pm and 12a, They are popular!
Haha yes that's too bad, mine did not either. Have you ever been to Japan by the way? Apparently baseball is really huge over there
Yeah I wouldn't mind just being a voice, I always wanted to work for my local radio station lol.
I recently switched from the Australian voice to the U.K version, gotta keep my women interesting fresh!
I read that and thought the same. I wonder how similar the Zebra Fish is to humans? Can we use that in medical research?
haha mine too. Do you that all votes in Canada are equal to all the votes in California minus 50 votes.
Robin Williams had always been a favorite of mine in the cartoon realm. I'm glad he started the trend of performing using his voice in animations because there have been a good share of excellent movies because of that.
Yeah, usually when my home team is doing good.
which surprises me , I always thought that that was something that pretty much everyone had touched upon in their time in office at least a little bit
I agree, everyone has a different body so I am going to listen to mine and try to progress, getting faster, stronger.
I love them! He cracks me up. I like corny goofball comedy. I used to like watching 3rd Rock from the Sun when it was on tv for that same reason.
aww that is cute, rescue dogs tend to be the best! I want to clone my dog when he passes he is that good. They have cloned cats before, but no thanks to a cat
True. I've used them over my head to keep the sun off me. lol
Wow, as much as I want to call him insane he seems more qualified than me, but I'm still a skeptic. Are you interested in clothing at all?
Not mine either. I'm surprised that there are no economic gains for the countries that have played host to the Olympics or the World Cup. I wonder if it's because they spend so much on the infrastructure for the events?
I've heard about that but never looked must have a lot of borinou reminded me, I really want to hear it for myself! That's very intriguing to me!
I would rather have amazon prime for life than a building named after me.
I dont have any myself, but I teach, so I see some humorous things every day.
If the goats get stock options, sign me up. I can eat grass. I'm not proud.
Oh yeah I didn't know that either. I also want to go to google Plex to see the goats who mow their lawn by eating it.
It's interesting, but I also find it kind ofchool so my parc human made objects. Birds are amazing to me! Some birds fly from Alaska to Mexico, without sleeping when migrating!
haha ya I like that, what is also wild to me is that there are more domesticated tigers living as pets than there are wild tigers living around asia
Earth never stops to amaze me, it was formed over 4.5 billion years ago and there is still much to learn about our planet
Yeah, it's hard for me to relate to scientists and all of their elaborate theories but Hawking was blessed with wit. He was quite the jokester, which makes him very relatable.
Dang! No wonder he wrote a lot of depressing stuff. Great chatting with you. Give your dogs a hug for me and I'll consider getting my kids a dog. Take care!
Oh, I know, Decades. There was so much and people today have no idea how great alot of it was!!
Exactly. Have you heard of the game send me to heaven?
Funny. I would love to learn more about a jellyfish that is immortal.
I missed mine too and also the chance to watch Linkin Park live, they performed 324 concerts in 2001 alone
I vaguely recall reading something in the Star Wars fictional universe where a young Han Solo stayed with Chewbacca and his mom in their home.
Absolutely, my husband has had the same sport's coat for years!
that is good, in my state no grocery store can sell alcohol
I'd rather watch comdies myself, wonder what calorie counts that burns, speaking of abstract art, have you ever watched forms of dance?
Oh my God that needs to be stopped immediately. I don't know how i haven't heard of this. What kind of stuff? I do know youtube is the second largest search engine on the internet.
Im going to try and put tea bags in my gym shoes. See if it works to absorb odor...
While my favorite is Hulk, I did really like the Captain America movie. It's the best of both worlds because he meets up with Tony Stark.
my friend met the siri lady in an airport once. that was interesting.
I wondered if the celebrity Anne Hathaway's name is inspired from that. I had no idea Pocahontas and Shakespeare were alive at the same time! They would've seemed to live in different eras to me.
i hate to admit it, but sometimes i like terrible movies. AND i used to watch the gotti family reality show years ago on VH1. So, this might just be up my alley lol
Kind of related, but I have totally tried to Google things when my power is out. Haha.
no way lol, all of my Facebook friends are well known to me.
He doesnt look like he has 56 years! I heard he made 75000000 from Mission Impossible 3
me too! This sounds fun though. There is an annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel. I wake up in the morning...
I would love to go there. I used to like reading Manga too.
Oh yeah. That sucker was mean let me tell you. I think I would have a rabid dog chase me, which by the way dogs are not color blind!
lol, yes, That was since January 2017. I love my Iphone its with me most of the day, like everyone else.
No, everyone thought it was awesome, but they kept calling my parents. So I had to give him back to the aquarium I got him from, but when I was inside I secretly bought an iguana. LOL
I ould see that. Play it for the time when he wrote it nd it makes more sense. Makes sense to me.
haha me too! I heard that they wore clothes that were full of color. Surprised me because I always thought of them as wearing black and white.
Waking up at 4 was tough when I first started but now, it's second nature. It's really a great option for me because I have no time to do it other wise. Its so relaxing and clears my mind.
i am no good at guitar myself, but that is cool of him, I know he uses coins as picks as well!
That is awesome. i think my favorie disney film would have to be either big hero 6 or the incredibles.
YES!  That was my favorite era of his!  Love, love the rockabilly stuff and he lost me as the lounge singer.  lol  Freddie Mercury of Queen wrote "crazy little thing called love" as a tribute to Elvis.
Let me guess, they have a McDonalds with free WiFi? I could never climb Everest. I would have to rebel against my internet addition and put down my device long enough to climb... I'll just Google it...
nice, loved my a sega! Each had great games. I wonder how many colors the Sega had, Nintendo has only 54 colors.
i agree, snakes are so creepy, they are a very lucky country in my opinion
I cried when I saw that part. Still makes me sad. She also suggested Leia's good luck kiss...
Yeah good call they sure do to me too! And yeah those eggs are massive, I know people eat those and ostrich eggs.
If you get a second watch the video, it is remarkable how accurate it is.  I'd never heard of it but an Australian friend of mine was fully aware.
The state rock song of Oklahoma is "Do You Realize?" by the Flaming Lips. I didn't know that states had rock songs.
Haha me as well shame is well hidden in shirts.
I think that he is taking a risk that could stop production and cost a lot of money. i see no need for it.
I wish I knew enough about the background to have an opinion, but the last Star Wars I watched was Episode III, when it came out on video. I really need to rewatch to refresh my memory of it.
That's kind of cool, I like it when people don't take themselves too seriously. Like when Kanye made fun of himself on SNL. If only he'd do it more.
Maybe he should. What did you think about that guy findin 3 million dollars worth of old baseball cards in his grandpas attic.
I thought maybe you had left in your car to go get something to eat at McDonalds...lol
haha ya, lots of waiting and doing nothihng, have you ever ridden a horse
Guccio Gucci! WHat a great name!  I call him "the gooch"  Now, you can buy "ecclesiastical clothing" from Gucci!
No, I've never been to turkey. Have you been?
Did you play with Legos growing up?
I think the movie tried to have an overall good message to be the best you can be in everything you do. Inspirational for many.
No I didn't but that's neat! I don't think I asked, but what games do you or did you play?
I did see it before. Speaking about the phone, Unicef will donate a day of clean water to a child in need for every minute you do not use your cell phone. Good practice.
Yes, I heard that too! That's strange to think about. Egosurfing is a term used when looking yourself up on the internet. I would think that would be for those who do it alot!  Good chat!
I wonder if that person even shows up to vote, or why he's in the jungle like that haha. Did you vote last election?
That's really nice of him! What a nice guy, why do you think Greenland can't join FIFA? Apparently it's because they can't grow green grass LOL
I kind of like the idea of being able to upload your mind to a computer and memory sticks because you would be leaving some kind of legacy behind after you're gone.
I was going to ask what you thought about it. Jack Black was going to star in the Green Lantern which was originally supposed to be a comedy.
I don't either, I wonder if it triggers something in your brain. Kind of crazy. Do you have a favorite shirt?
Somehow they think it stops thieves. I can only assume that you can put flame throwers anywhere on your vehicle. That way, if the thief comes to the door you can deter him.
Hmm I am not sure, How do you even calculate that to be honest?
I wonder if you get extra credit if you start growing your hair out for that class? lol I had a mythology and fantasy class in college. It was pretty good.
I think you have to know somebody. It sounds like it involves few duties. Mostly waiting.
The Republican Party is really popular in the states do you agree?
It's probably super expensive to upload your mind to a computer, there probably won't be many fans left at the end of it all
I hope not! Otherwise I am going there to stop it! They should do what boulder does and make it so you don't own pets but are their guardian
yes, burglars can be pretty quick, so you need to "stay on your toes" when it comes to tying your shoes.
If you ever get a chance you should check this show, there's some amazing creatures down there. 84% of genes that are associated with diseases have counterparts in the Zebrafish.
Yeah. Can't be too hurried while your life is on the line or it will take too long.
Oh yeah, that would have been good. Are you interested in history? I was reading about Lincoln. He had a high pitched voice, I guess.
I saw the movie. It has Leonardo DiCaprio I think it was directed by Ridley Scott. I actually liked that movie a lot. did you see the movie Wonder Woman by the way
Do you think Rotten Tomatoes is a good site for reviews
oh what games have you played? I used to play a lot of them but the more recent ones havent been great
Yes! If I were going, I'd enjoy putting together a playlist of my favorite albums, like Apollo 11/NASA did. Any album you'd insist on for your playlist?
I think we see the light at the end of the tunnel! Enjoy your weekend!
Have you heard of this game? Astro Bot Rescue Mission' rekindles the fun gaming for even the most jaded
I'm not overall but I do love shoes. Were you aware that there are at least 17 ways to tie your shoes?
Yeah it would be. No, I don't really have a favorite, how about yourself?
I could definitely see that. What were your favorite video games? Jane McGongiai was the game designer behind that study, pretty cool.
Wow that is crazy long. Well it was nice chatting with you. Have a good day.
I suppose talent could run in the family. I wonder what kind of personality you would need: spending hours inside your head, thinking of the moves and countermoves.
That is true. Did you hear about that time in 1957 when Truman refused to be photographed with Dumbo
That is funny. I always thought of them as a punishment hat. Well it has been nice chatting with you have a good evening.
Looked very cool, when he did it! I heard somewhere that Tupac danced ballet. Have you heard anything about that?
I agree, so do you like fiction?
I did play with Legos, my favorite, what  about you?
Yes, but video are viewed more negatively than TV, that is why you have legislation in some countries limiting the time played by children.
I have too! Have you seen The Room? It's my favorite terrible movie, they actually made a movie about its cult following called Disaster Artist with Tommy Wiseau. Have you heard of this? That definitely deserves a Razzie award@
I guess they must show respect for each other. The rap battle in which your glorious opponent is also worthy of respect.
Wow, did you ever try any of the baseball games on playstation?
That won't earn you any robot friends, do don't ruin my plans ok, I can place your mind in a horror film if you try to warn others.
So, what do we have here, albums and Drake. Albums? Drake? Albums. What is your favorite album?
Probably, make up can really transform you into almost anyone
I agree with you! Especially with the box office at what it is. I would hate to work for the movie Trojan Wars. They made only 309 dollars on a budget of 15 million!
they are/ I like grand Torino especially. what is your fave?
Yeah, can't make good choices when your sugar has dropped! It can't believe it took until 1993 for women to wear pants on the senate floor.
interesting. There is a UNICEF program that donates clean water for every minute you do not use your phone.
you get to wear panda costumes while working with them!
I think that in this day and age, you need to capture the younger viewer to make your medium longer lasting. They may not relate to the same jokes that have sustained the comic industry for so long.
Probably, I really enjoyed that. What is your favorite Taylor Swift song?
I don't have a favorite but there are several that I like. How about yourself?
Oh wow that's very cool! Hey at least if you ever want to pick up a new show after, Nat Geo Wild has a show that parodies Game of Thrones but follows lions!
I do. Can you believe when Arnold Schwarzenegger was governor of CA he never lived in Sacramento, instead he commuted 3 hours every day by private jet.
What do you think of Serena Williams?
yup their thing is for every day you don't use your cellphone they will donate a day of clean water
I totally agree with you but on the other hand, it is kind of cool and makes the movies more realistic.  Although Mission Impossible-Fallout is pretty far out there as far as realism goes.
Have you ever been on a blind date?
Yes I agree with you! I watch YouTube almost everyday. I can't believe that Google bought YouTube for 1.65 billion dollars back in 2006. That seems like so long ago
Yes!  I believe you are correct.  The triplets in the movie are named the Bimbette sisters.  That's your useless fact of the day.  lol
that is interesting I always wondered that, do you use google for your searches? or another website?
It's really interesting. So with your sciatic nerve removed, have you lost a lot of motor function?
yes, happy birthday. you have your own superhero! LOL. the universe is a big place and there is plenty of room for new superheros.
Yeah I haven't seen those movies but I heard they were just awful. Another hilariously bad movie is called Rubber, it's a horror movie. Have you seen or heard of it? It deserves a Razzie for sure.
Oh I didn't know that. Have you seen that movie is it any good?
I agree! What are your views on the Golden State Warriors?
I think I have read that before as well, I think it would be so wild to see your manager take an at bat!
I think its a really long and boring name lol, I do like to play video games as well do you have a PlayStation system?
Well I personally prefer tennis, but I also like lacrosse, did you hear about the spring all met boys lacrosse team?
Nope. Glad they used the nickname, Minnie. What's your favorite Disney film?
Hm. I thought it was animation. I guess you mean the remake? I never saw that. It was probably great as well.
I used to but not any more. I love your tradition of waving to the chidlren's hospital. So touching.
Good Morning! Have you ever heard of K-Pop?
Yes, I have. There good! Have you?
I bet they are in the top 110 brands with that kind of an income! DOn't you think?
How about basketball, is that more of your thing?
Someone stole your gnome? Who steals a gnome? Was it the travelocity gnome looking for a friend?
Probably pretty scary, apparently you can burn more than 180 calories watching a horror movie
Yes they donate clean water. And they will donate a day of clean water for every minute you do not use your cell phone apparently. I need to look into that more
he is a great guy! i think he is a great guy and a tremendous actor. what film of his is your favorite?
by the way, do you watch movies with superhero? Who is your favorite?
I did not know about this fact. I am wondering if it is still in effect. By the way, nice chatting with you
I took a horse ride once and live in an area with lots of horses. They are beautiful animals. you?
Yeah. Have you ever ridden in the jurassic park ride?
Are you familiar with Native American books?
I haven't seen it, but I'll take your word for it.
Yeah, the humble brag, the social comparisons, it is not good for your mind. better to go out and do things that you enjoy.
Who was your favorite Beatle? Think I like Ringo just 'cause he's kinda goofy.
I do, what do you think about Prices injury?
Me too, what do you think about Fox news? Apparently they are watched more than msnbc and cnn combined.
i don't believe i've seen those. i don't follow the marvel series too closely. i do know chris pratt plays a role in a show on tv, parks and rec. have you seen it?
I did not know that. Very interesting. Well, it was good chatting with you.
I do, every year a new costume, you know Panda researchers wear a panda costume for work.
Yeah that is so lame to me. If you don't like it, then you learn your lesson and don't buy any more tickets to any more concerts.
Which is honestly just nuts. And when you combine Netflix and youtube, it's half of the peak internet traffic in North America alone!
Really?  Which ones did that?  Seems like you always hear of big names rejecting parts and then finding out the movies do fantastic.
That's a good idea! Well, it's been fun and fast chatting with you this morning. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day, friend!
Cat Woman! and you who is yours? If they had made Batman with Bill Murray ad Eddie Murphy I would expect to laugh. I just look at Bill Murray and he makes me laugh!
I have to say House of Cards or Better Call Saul, what about yours?
Yeah me neither, what did you think about Katy Perry and her wings?
That would be scary. When you turn 100 in Japan, the PM sends you a silver cup to celebrate.
That sounds delicious, is that your favorite omelet?
I wonder how Unicef would even know if you were using your cell phone or not
Hi! So do you like music? I love rock music and well many other genre's.

Yeah, that is pretty weird isn't it? I wonder if it is true. Well, nice chatting with you.
I have taken yoga before but I need a few more classes before I get more flexible. It was fun chatting with you, have a great day!

Which is your favorite film of of the original trilogy?
That is really crazy! What are some of your favorite animals by the way? I know that I really like dogs.

Good chatting with you too. Enjoy your clothing. I will enjoy mine.
Ah, no, I never was able to understand poetry. It was nice talking with you, have a great rest-of-your-day!
I do not know how you get in but I am sure you probably have to write a paper and use your best idea's but it would be very cool!
that must be an awesome spectacle to watch it eat. a good way to get rid of your enemies! LOL
Hey there how often do you use your telephone?
Florida does not seem like your typical hockey place, but then again, neither does Washington DC
Well, if you l the villains then they are your super hero,
ya I think he won a dancing championship actually! I guess martial arts are just dance moves used for defending yourself haha
yeah, it is a silly look. nobody wants to see your drawers. Have a good night!
I guess New Zealand would be ideal for you, with no snakes and all
i never realized how good dogs were at knowing what pointing is. but if you point, a dog will follow your finger. its great

I agree with you. Did you ever play the video game LittleBigPlanet or Harry Potter? Apparently the same person did the narration in both of those video games, his name is Stephen Fry
Yeah, it seems that way, or maybe rotated at a bigger speed, you know we have an embassador in case aliens arrive to the planet or try to make contact with us.
No I agree with you. Are you going to watch the Academy Awards by the way? They give out 24 Awards and I think that the first broadcast was back in 1930, which is wild
Wow, that is a long time to take to write a script. Well, nice chatting with you!
Such gorgeous dogs! Do you & your dogs live in a northern climate?
Stan lee is excellent writer also, he make the movie interesting. Which is your favourite sports ?
I agree. How do you like Emma Watson? From what I have seen people love her or hate her, I think especially to when she speaks on certain subjects.
Very true. Did you now polo shirts were initially invented be a famous tennis player?
No I didn't see that. It's interesting that 23 former Nationals attended it though, did you see it?
Interesting. Have you ever had carpel tunnel syndrome brought on by playing games?
No, I haven't see it. Have you?
Yeah, you should give it a try, I wonder what surprises will bring this years awards!
I guess the lesson is, don't trust your life to the planets, or a paid advise columnist.
I always like the TZ. Did you see the movie The Revenant?   It was a 1971 film of wilderness survival.  Leo did a great job.
I love me some disney movies! Which is your favorite?
i agree with you. it happened several years ago. it says pro-trumpers found them and posted them to social media. that seems odd...

I never watch the show, do you think he would have done a better job?
What do you think about the United Nations appointing an ambassador to extraterrestrials? I wonder what he does all day, sounds like the most boring job in the world because obviously we haven't had contact yet
I was worried the Sun or smoke had voided the warranty on your computer
Well, im not really an expert on such matters, anything that scares you enough. Anyway, great chat! good luck with your foxhole!
You know your Disney films! I enjoy animation, but usually the ones for adults, not kids.
yikes, I don't think that name would go over so well in the USA lol. It was so nice chatting with you, enjoy your day!
Well, San Diego will be more hot than warm. Really? Is there a meaning behind it? Or does it mean that you should not call your child after a band?
Maybe I am not sure but the singer was Joe Perry, lead guitarist of Aerosmith. It was nice chatting with you :)
Just the opposite - FB promises an eternity of jealousy and self loathing because Becky and Donna - your FB "friends" have better vacation photos than you
That is over 150 earth years, don't get a mortgage from a banker on Neptune, your grand-grand-grand-children will still have payments.

I have been playing for about 10 years now and another thing I wanted to mention that the golf course consists of 18 holes but if you play the game for fun its usually 9 holes.
Yea plus you can find yourself in trouble if you rely on google maps since they tailor disputed countries to the claims of each country depending on which country you are in

So she was supervising me and she would like correct my work incorrectly. For example. Oh, it is.
When by myself, I'm the biggest target. For every, all the people try. All the camels, you know.
Washing it every day isn't like work for me. I feel like taking a shower. It's actually easier sometimes to get my hair wet than it is to try and not get my hair wet.
I've been taking my kids they are real athletic so so I will be going to play basketball with them and doing all that stuff and taking them to games
I know that's what the whole neighbourhood has, it has definitely changed
I really enjoyed myself.
you know, more so than people from my real dad's side. Because I actually saw those people, growing up. I was over their houses and they treated me like family.
now I've done, I don't know. Let me see, look at my stats. But anyways, you see the progress in each child that even if they have another teacher, it's a good thing.
I think we can move onto the next subject which is what is that we are talking about anyway how Amazon is replacing retail?
so they were pulling up my phone number or from specific bell or whatever what might have been to time wanner,
and they give me just good ideas and then I save them to my list on amazon and then I'll eventually get around to buying them or it'll take me down a hole and I can
with a bunch of my summer earnings, I stayed in Manhattan with a friend of mine.
tour places, you think I can't do this myself. I mean there's graffiti on the wall my goodness I ain't just gonna walk down that street.
having some kind of dessert afterwards whether it's a little piece of chocolate like my mouth immediately says to me like, you have to get some sugar, strange!
I just have to text mine let's move on to the next subject which is my last vacation?
which is cool. I went to Greece because a really close friend of mine was gonna speak with her husband
with my big vacation down to Florida for a couple of days. And then in South southwest
we don't like that down here my mother's not really into sports like that my Moms like sports first.
I do, I would say ninety per cent of my shopping there and there are some speciality items that they don't have whatever I am looking for specific kind of papers or something for a particular recipe,
I like schooled in London by myself. So it was really fun. And, even though I was like technically going to school but that was a vacation.
and she'd like spread my legs open and like stand in between, you know, and like, I don't know, for me it was just so weird.
he'll tell me that it was crazy for black people, the year my father was born, so Martin Luther King got assassinated, so my father always tell me stories about that
I mean, she is not clear that was my favourite show growing up. I mean, I know you didn't ask me anything, but the coffee show was the best.
Where did you have like I'm talking to myself again?
But that's my news, but seeing at it, I cannot watch it, that I don't really, but Bloomberg, I watch Bloomberg TV

my oldest daughter, she is Sammy, she is wow, she'll talk and then she is very emotional but she is a girl, so I had to really
a friend of mine had seriously considered doing a food truck. She and her boyfriend were gonna go in on it and she was gonna cook whatever
I know it's true. It is really, even like I wish I felt, like other friends of mine too, who are like of my same age. We used to go out
Snowwhite. My mom told me I probably watched it like every single day. I'm very excited
Why would I pay them to do what I could do if I don't know if I would feel confident enough to do it myself just because I'm like a chicken about that
Yeah. It is creepy and that's why it took me so long to go to New Orleans because I have been wanting to go to New Orleans forever but I refused to go after Katrina. It broke my heart
I cannot imagine my mother could continue associating with me if I chose to go on a show like that.
I've never worked with a brick oven myself.
Yeah, I've seen a lot of that.
Yeah, itÂ´s the same My my dad is a lawyer and wanted to push me into law forever. My mum is a therapist
Although I like a sweet breakfast it's just like it never feels like I'm doing something that's great for myself, you know?
I figured that there would be friends of mine and people in my life, who he would meet as appropriate if they're showing up enough in the baby's life
they had just built Harry Potter whipping world Harry potter. Me and my brother were huge Harry Potter fans. I need some more of him.
It still has little cover sheets and it's really funny. I'm like, ok let me

my dad text me saying Manny died I always knew uncle I just never met Manny
That concerns me.
and it just brings you so much joy, and it's like I'm getting mine, she's getting hers, everyone is happy. Why all of a sudden when it's not in that container where you feel maybe a little bit emptier
My vacation was more of a staycation. So, I went to Washington DC where I'm from
excuse me. But anyway I've enjoyed the last calendar year of different trips
really stuff like that but I learnt that from my family that's just how my family is, real tough, real discipline, real militaristic
I have a thing against guys named Sam but I got past it. Anyways she started dating she was a year older than me so junior year my sophomore year,
Well, that's true but I don't know, it's something about better places disturbing to me in general, I don't know, not that cleaning a stranger's apartment in a bikini isn't disturbing but
Oh! A friend of mine actually lives there, so I was going to visit with her and it was really nice because I didn't have to get a hotel room and things like that so.
He just wanted me to do science
Well, they're reopening now, but also everyone who works there. They're reopening there New Jersey my boyfriend maybe really wants to go with me and I really don't want to go
So we went down to the city and we ate and we don't speak Spanish, My husbands Spanish is better than mine and we can find a bathroom, a cab
I feel like it gives me a new school vibe, you get new clothes, say I'm ready, my life, but I got a new phone case.
They wanted me to be like an engineer. Science. You know what I mean. But I found my own way. You know what I'm saying. Word.
I know that it's different with me with my grandson because he's not mine. Even though I've been waiting for him I'm not gonna have any expectations of this book. I'm just gonna hope.
or just a lot of stuff that's really inexpensive so in comparison to a lot of other prices, so I honestly do and like ninety per cent of my grocery shopping, yeah.
Yeah, my high school boyfriend tried to get me to watch Star Wars but I never really got into it. Yeah. I'm sure it is. I mean even maybe if it wasn't trying to

Serious she got but my youngest son he's into puzzles, he likes puzzles, (indoor) games
Yeah, me there, I just wait for a long time to the next store and which are my biggest expenses.
But, it was really interesting for my wife to watch that. Not so much for me cause I kind of already know how that goes.

I didn't say anything I just kept my mouth shut. But so we went I told myself now that we are in Miami we have to eat and it's really close
I think I had definitely a lot of what you were talking about. Like I always, for example like my best friend ((myself, Matt and Tylarl)) have been best friends since forever
from amazon using it, I can just talk out loud and tell it to order something for me, and it'll be delivered to my house for me. It's great.
It just makes me so angry and then depressed, you can't really do anything about it.
The thing that kills me about Jed was that he kept talking about his career, what is gonna happen with my career when I'm out on the road
They just give me a bank account with enough zeroes in it that I don't have to worry about it, my kids don't have to worry about it, my grandkids don't worry
And he said, my parents went through the Holocaust and the only thing that they instilled in me growing up is we gave up everything to continue
yes, I have actually. I've made that before my mom raised me making it in the microwave. She would make rice
That's good for reminding me because I have to check in on my little brother and make sure he's doing all his school work. I don't think anyone is staying on top of him for that.
the holidays. Awesome. No new dog. hung out with my parents
So we're at an hour. Alright, so so the guys will send me back and thank

Yeah, tell me about it. Okay, tell me that story bro.
And they encouraged me to download it and I was like, oh I have it. And then I was like, would I have it on my phone though?
She's in the living room and I'm in the kitchen, I can hear and I can focus on that, but she wants me to move my body over so she can see that I am focused on her.
I mean, my friend works for UNFI which is like United Natural Food like they are distributors of all kind of natural foods and products
When I get rich, my first thing is to get my father a Superbowl ticket, that'd be great. Doing stuff like that
gonna get a lot of something I do every day anyway because I couldn't afford to do it every day, but you know it's surprising to me how much the crap food really is?
Yeah, I like the food buyer, I don't really find the food to be like so like Oh, my god! Trader Joe's is so incredible.
And he apparently was depressed and his mom asked my mom to ask me to ask him to come to this party.
I've got myself a note that means we gonna have to a little bit more
it's like whatever, it's not my problem, they just take it.
Do you want to list more people or should I keep going? Let me keep on going. Let's see I got, I have my friend
earn by that, because there was this South Korean deli, I think the second street of the Avenue A and then they opened up Gracefully and it's just
me, her, and Soledad dancing to what was the song some high school musical, oh God I don't remember it was some Hannah Montana, a high school musical song.
He's like, oh my gosh. He would not like every time he drives me crazy. I'm watered out, I'm going to the bathroom every hour, I'm drinking a gallon a day.
do all the stuff and just because it's just family first over everything and just doing that and just following that it's just it means a world to me
It's kind of an odd thing but it's easy for me to remember because Sunday is the day that my boss took the schedule for the week. So I'm going to exit out.
Okay, interesting. Yeah, I know I never returned anything from this. I bought some other day and then I was thinking to myself because it was a gift for someone, I got it
I was a friend at The University of Virginia, he is actually a friend of Bezos's daughter. There is some like they hanging out. No, they are pretty close friends
That's how much I pay for me and my mother and Maggie's bill with the phone Yeah.
Oh my god, I can't believe he said that. That's why he said it
decent salary to put on a show somewhere and then go home and not be like, Oh my god, the rent is so expensive or, you know, I'm living in it. You're living in Los Angeles
let me just. I can again. it's funny because football season is about to end and it's like that's it. I watch TV during football season and then after football season I was just like
Did I tell you about this friend who I hadn't talked to in a while, whom my mom asked me to invite
What's happening, something weird is happening on my network do you hear me now?
I think my grandkid would tell me he grew up to be an electrician farmer there and she levels self-pack something you know.
I mean this is very rare that they even say anything
Yeah, I mean it sounds like you had a great experience than me. I mean, the reason why I like Ireland
He happened to tell me what debt is, now you have too much money and you are not paying attention.
I got to travel and see my family seeing them more is
I'd say we have to research it both ways, and then my friend I think it was somewhere around the time of Black Friday or something,
the person coming through the doors and then show me, touching, like rubbing my belly and then starting to sing and then the people moving away?
that's crazy and people tell me they have got a lot of family members and stuff like fifty cousins  that's a whole lot of people
I'm going through everything to devise a plan because there's so much to cancel but I just wanna first organize myself before I actually.
He called me and had me come in and I was well I was working in the cafe end they needed my help while I was working outside like it was trashy
Even on the suicide squad, he was like, I started feeling myself generally going crazy. I guess working in Phoenix
I was watching that, me and my wife were watching that, we were enjoying that, it was cool, I liked them I didn't even know he had a daughter
And are just so different from mine and I really enjoy just having a conversation with him just to see those differences where the coffee project made an event
I guess I'm just talking to myself again.
it's sort of like, okay, everything's sort of coming together. This is nice. and my mom messaged me saying, Oh, you know, would you like to stay with Stella, who's a family friend of ours?
I remember my mom telling me, Oh, you know, don't tell people that we went back to the same place like twice. I was like, why?
You know my thoughts on animals I personally think anyone who likes first started using that an animal deserves to be like murdered themselves, but I've ever been, like, you know,
It's definitely a very touchy subject. There's actually a book called Freakonomics that my friend Boo told me about.
I don't think my daughter took me to a restaurant. There's a lot of people from Hong Kong in Georgia. She loves that food and we went in, it was inside.
I don't have a DVD player. Why would I be carrying all my DVDs with me?
yeah you should be marrying into mine
I didn't like it, so I used it for a month and I sent them back.
Now you got me shook. I'm like oh my God! Like no, but really we discussed that I am not like that type of person that I don't need that.
this lady just spent like an insane amount of time with me going through all these potential boost and shoes and you know, my wife was just blown away because in Mexico
and doing more but, I just don't see my family as much as I needed to, I wish I had more time, do other stuff
A moment there you're tempted to go into somebody's apartment, and take them and be like, oh sorry we rented it out to me for short term and now I'm taking it.
In my head that I kind of writing on a daily basis, so I would like to think of myself of doing that but I've never been able to do that so
Airbnb like where I'm going to stay, I like to consider transportation, like Bangkok, we didn't even look into it. That was my first international trip by myself with a friend.
Yes, it all just sounds just so crazy to me that's why I have really never gotten into it, it's just like I can't wrap my mind around such stuff.
And then I think that hotel itself is gonna be far easier than that but I'm still trying to get myself organized. Got it?
me and my friends would just drink on the boardwalk, drink on the beach.
(Totally) I had to pay extra but anyway, I got the day by myself on this island and it's amazing!
Because they turn over so quick that I always challenge myself to find whatever is the cheapest best place you can get to from the Canal station. You know
It's different for you and I am like; why it is different for me? And they would say, because, when you walk around in these weddings, they think, you are part of the wedding party.
Let me tell you those beds are so uncomfortable, you know they are older beds they don't get new stuff there and my back was killing me, I mean I'm so young
you know, so they just asked me a lot of questions about whether or not I had ever worked over a forty-hour week
always put family over everything like everything in me backbone there, it just helps out a lot, just having that family structure
we would wander around London at night. Because me and my dad can never fall asleep, we both have
It could happen to me when I get old, but then when you have another person, like a young person someone who is dependent on you, it could
So then that's was like. They came from the south and they came in New York and just everything so all my generation (is) family that wasn't still so
Yeah, she is a friend of mine
since sixth grade because they wanted me to switch to softball and play with the girls, and I didn't want to. I never played softball. I never played softball in my life. so I quit.
and you can try to kick me out. We're gonna check in the next day, you're in court
And so where it truly fell apart is that is when my mom was out of town and she would be there to look after me and make sure that
Yeah that's correct. My my family is like that
Well, I think that they are waiting for everybody to move into that building
When I went last summer I told my family, I appreciate you guys always driving us around everywhere, but I need to figure this around by myself.
start to like screaming, they're like screeching at me. I was like what is going on, and they're pointing at my foot and I look down and my entire calf is covered in blood.
the old friend of mine used to work there. It's so funny
cut back down it as it never seemed to get any get lower, but rent is definitely my biggest expense and it's not a reach out thing. I don't know I guess retail expense.
I was, a friend of mine at the University of Virginia is actually friends with benefits with daughter, they hand out, they're pretty close friends.
trying to do more for my mom help her out.
Yesterday was very warm. When it's very warm like that, and then it suddenly drops, makes it extra cold to me anyway. I feel like my body gets ready for the cold, then it's like.
Oh, that is so sweet. Let me tell Blue is good looking too, she is so pretty. Like I said my attraction is not sexual in any way.
So basically there is, just like put them in. I would stand at the back, they never even wanted to see my footage but practically they were just able to charge for me
And I just had my writing. I give journal classes and I did posing classes. I couldn't write share Doctor Holland. You give me silver, you know, I can write fiction still.
I mean I dunno. It's never really been a thing for me, some of my friends like are, were so and some of them still are so desperate to get married and I just can't really, I dunno.
I mean I know I find myself victim to this just like browsing through Amazon or High End Sneakers or clothes
Very much agreed. I contrast that experience with the experience I had with the overnight nurse at the hospital this time? The overnight nurse who tried to correct me with my pronouns?
Oh. it just that my neighbour and I talk about this all the time too, is because of every block there is another Giant, building going up with.
water down version of myself and Joe's family is actually married into Puerto Rican culture, so like a lot of his uncles have Puerto Rican wives
it never was for me so, for better or worse I don't know what I got to say
but he didn't say he was not invited for Thanksgiving and they talked about Cuba and everything and the next day my dad sends me a text, I am sorry
me and Rodney went bang, shoulder to shoulder, and my shoulder still clicks to this day. I never got it looked at. I never got it fixed. You know
I cut off my coffee recently. If I've been pushing myself to drink a lot more water but I cannot live without my sparkling water. I don't know what it is.
And it's  people who are interesting actors, but of course, my all-time favourite actor is the only actor, like celebrity actor that I really care about is Johnny Depp
And that's probably my favorite of all those spots. I also really like the Mexicans and so sometimes they go to my favorite Mexican restaurant
that's something that's really scary to me too I am always thinking in the back of my mind how they're doing
I do,  actually I shop at the Trader Joe's liquor store, I don't shop at the Trader Joe's
I don't need that bringing stuff up in me and then I react wrong, I need to have a handle on my stuff and know how I react so that I'm prepared for this situation, feel me?
that's why I have them around my parents and stuff like that
Our kids, they don't get the chance to enjoy school and enjoy the stuff that school is more enjoyable, kids will have more fun with it, when I was growing up, that was part of my family value
DJ Hu or whatever I will give myself some credit
And it was me, her, my grandma, my parents, and Joe, Jackie for whatever reason wasn't there, and it was really fun. It was really weird and fun
see just give me our bank account was enough zeros in it I don't have to worry about it my kids don't have to worry about it my grandkids don't worry
When I say attentive he won't even let me take my purse out of my car. Just an amazing human being. So, he is from Cuba,
pettiness is my theme and I know. Just because I know myself, I know that I could stoop to some mean language
Hang it up to dry somewhere. What do you want from me?
just wanna think of my family in general and all of that stuff
And now that feels just like I'm not worth it to me but, it is incredible how expensive it is and like not worth it.
not the best time for me so I spent most of my senior year
What's mine? Well, I watch Hoarders.
rebel against them and then, later on, you come to realize, oh you know what it was a really good thing they did for me and I shouldn't have fought so hard on it, you know
You know. The phone really, I mean. I feel half the time my phone is quicker and easier to get, get me information than my computer is but into the go faster.
I need some attention over here. You are talking with a person on the computer all the time, talk to me.
But at the same time, it's just the return, it's just the amount of stuff I return
As for myself, I would just study languages.
yes, like I just get along with my wife's mother, I don't really get along with my father
it's really good to me. I really like it.
much more like leggings, so I have a lot of those. As opposed to my mom's clothing that she's given me where she's the older style dress pants with
the giant debacle and the other girl was in drama class with me so it was this very awkward situation where I was like I didn't know I wasn't trying to hurt you
He named me after his pops.
Visit the sites that are important to me. My ideal vacation is not to be merry or anything but rather to visit
Yeah, my sister-in-law is a hugger and she'll hug me and I will keep my hands down I don't wanna, I mean, it's like you get wrapped.
I knew nothing about the real world, and I just went off to college and somebody had to teach me about the real world, pay for it, because my parents didn't do it.
part of my daughter's. the comments that she has was from me talking I remember them rolling their eyes going to stop talking mum
No, I am not talking about include conversations, but do you ever think oh this is important to me, or I am doing this and I wouldn't be doing this if it weren't for my culture.
find it within myself to know that I am worthy, that I am enough. That I love myself enough to be able to be okay, not even okay to be joyful in my partner's experience.
Shakira. Of course, the first thing is she can't deal with this air bubble-like all my computers messed me up.
constantly beyond my game. I am okay
like us in the beginning, they'll be talking to the crowd, and they'll be, Wow you guys really are good friends of mine or with the new band, you know, come on the road with you
my mom would never send me cash or give me food.
Yeah, my older brother got a daughter.
I couldn't really watch it. The extent of me liking those stuff is like Mean Girls, the movie. Barely Legal, things like that. I like that but it's like
Yeah it's very interesting to hear about it because, to me it's actually very similar. My relation to that is very similar to my relationship to religious believers.
How frequently we meet our family? I see mine like twice a year really My parents that is
No, I think mine Go on, I 'm sorry.
beautiful storytelling so me and my roommates got a little obsessed with it last semester since we started watching to the cast and you could tell the whole cast
You know my co-worker is Dominican and she is great, but it really is a complete contradiction of my culture, so it is hard for me to accept her culture.
Because it's my body. and can't tell me what to do with it.
That's and luckily, my jobs allows me time to do that. Even though, I am teaching a lot now since everyone is home with this global pandemic we're having.
I've applied for some job that the ASPCA, unfortunately, I don't think they would pay enough that I would even begin to support myself
his sister is my father's, his mother is my father's sister, and she, I notice she has anger issues and felt they felt sorry about who goes to see them
Okay, coming on to the next thing which is what concerns me the most? What concerns you the most?
the quickly they could get me where I need to be.
Well, I was going to say so I think my sophomore or junior year of high school, me and my family went down to Orlando for Christmas.
write. Handwrite my cover sheet and I'm gonna put in and dial the number, make sure to dial mine first and like whatever, it's kind of funny, I'm like ok.
And it was strange to talk about myself in front of people, I don't know
I myself too. I find any time I eat anything salty. I try to diet, and I try not to use the word diet because I remember in high school, a health teacher told me
No, this was my very first time and they told me that to get to the bunny hill I had to take the ski lift and I bought it.
I mean maybe this is me again just like as you said living in my own reality, but from what I heard it was not going well for him.
he kissed me and I was like oh holy shit whatever and anyway and then the show ended and then I
it surprised me I never had any doubts about my mum, but my father grew up Orthodox. And he still pretty much is, he's a Rabbi, he teaches at the Jewish Theological Seminary which is conservative.
I don't even have to call, and sit on hold, and push the buttons, or whatever. I just enter in my cellphone number, and they call me, automatically, and then I'm instantly connected to a person who solves my problem.
so to me my uncles and my aunts, they're not a part of my life. I wish they were, but they're not and then it's just my mom, who's a single parent.
Let's check it out because we were young we were sort of excited for what sort of might happen. And my friend at that time said let me grab a bat just in case
Yeah, my, me and working I don't know, I once
I doubt it. They wouldn't they thought that are going to happen.
sometimes at that store, and sometimes at another store it was kind of up to me to keep track of how many hours I worked and they're like okay I can except
in my home fries. And let me get a side of home fries I don't even care.
mine is said to expand the period of fasting when you wake up and to try to go as long as you can without having that breakfast meal.
I'm just like, well that's a little crazy advances to me.
let me just check in with my wife and I'll shoot you a text
Alright, let me quickly search you in my system.
Not really to be honest. I realized that it's just not for me. It's not for my body for some reason. ,
just talk to my old friend I'm like no, I'm totally normal they're like me, we talk about the same things. I'm just not in a good, this isn't a good fit for me.
both my parents were the people that introduced me to the theatre and I'm always deeply grateful for that. And then my dad when I was
Yeah, it's what I'm trying to do myself, do you watch it or?
probably meant well at least, for me, I feel like most parents ultimately want what's best for them and even if they don't always show it in the best way or the way that
so I could very much feel myself getting very angsty and resistant
Putting the product in your hand before you even get there.
We don't think you should go if you can't find your wallet and I was like, no, I can find it. So I got it and then we went downtown
so to me it feels like I'll do the wrong thing then maybe I can more likely have a very large family like yourself,
Do you still wanna rely on human error, or is tech gonna be that exact, and that's just how you're gonna play your game, down to the millimetre?
And a way of expressing yourself it's like, you know, the examples that you gave do mean there's a whole lot more cynicism.
great grandfather, you know what I am saying that's how it is
Well, on the profile it said this person visits your city frequently so it would open up an opportunity to meet them, once a month, twice a month,
Well, I guess it's just in your blood then.
And the best that I like there are certain things like olive oil, like anything that I see that they are doing
help me get some money, make some money give me money, you know what I am saying
sit down and make sure everybody on your Twitter feed see the real deal
Oh my God! Why do you pay so much?
Are you ever worried that in the future when you do have the smart devices that your kids will say, Oh. I would love to order a blank from Amazon and then they say, hey so and so
Can I have your phone number, please?
Yep. And especially if you're lying too, and then you are intentionally getting caught in your lies. Then you also make yourself, you look not smart.
So you worked out yourself naturally. Okay, that's great.
your plans for the future like what type you are generally speaking?
if you are gonna get diner food, like Denny's is not gonna be your best culinary option.
you understand.
Yeah you know what I am saying now. Word.
You know, depressed, they're not your friend, they're not, it's not your friend walking around and it's like you have to treat
you'd have to port your number over to somebody else and then they were like, I don't know what do you need the number for?
So let us see what we got here. But first of all how was your party?
you tell me yours and I will get back to you on that.
I'll give you I could see if we could go to the place where you will see all your family members.
So what about your team, you mentioned that you have a pretty good relationship with your co-workers.
But I mean, to know your thoughts on baseball because baseball is pretty fenced up, either it's a strike, or it's not a strike, but the human error aspects.
Is that a deeply thought belief of yours?
Sure, may I also get your ZIP code and street name, please?
we're not going to be able to sleep. Obviously, your security team is ill-equipped to deal with this. This is like insanity that we're not having to call a third time
on the computer at the same as we check it out with your friends, deal with your kids or your band you know, so it's a fact of life a lot of people do get the news that way.
Being safe and protecting yourself from STDs and stuff like that.
really? What do you think it's gonna bring people into your carpet whereas
I mean in terms of hospitality, what are you thinking about restaurants? Like if you go out to a restaurant, it's your birthday. Where are you headed? Like you choose anywhere anyway,
if it's (piled) into you know lower quality I just lose it. Okay, what kinda your favourite movie genre?
No. Men should have no say in it, sorry. It's not your body.
like what? What happened to your arm? I didn't want to say anything. I wouldn't even know how to say it and I'd say I got cut
Can I have your phone number from which you called us previously?
That's another thing. You have to think on your feet because they always do things that are unexpected.
you know what I am saying?
How was your day?
Oh that's awesome but girl let me tell you, so it sounds like Amber girl you guys have everything set for your beautiful, tranquil, loving, romantic
he can pick your family but you can pick your friends as I say which has always been an interesting dynamic and I neither I mentioned this briefly
that just feels so big it might seem little in the beginning, it is really super big, stuff that they're doing for you.
Okay. So the end goal is your gonna become a mental health counsellor. And you prefer to work with adults with mental health issues. And substance abuse issues, excuse me.
we were doing I don't know something talking about emotions or whatever acting school and Cathleen was like how did was like when was you and your boyfriend's first kiss and I was like
where is your family originally come from where do you guys are if you point on a map
I hope to visit your country in the near future. that's perfect and simple and sweet and that's it. oh, it says. Hope it is.
you know that, parents are just so important like everything you are doing in life and just gone, especially my father will be crazy
while sitting in the back of your car and not having to focus on the road. How many hours a year you spend driving versus how you can use that to be more productive.
you know what I am saying you've got to
Okay so as a consumer, you don't really care about who makes it, who it makes money for, who it helps employ, you just want to get the best price for yourself.
So I'll just continue with these tourist artefacts, basically, that's what it was. So there are small booths size of your bathroom, you know single bathroom every single booth has the same thing.
Yeah I actually I really did like your ideas, those ideas sounded to me like why isnÂ´t somebody in a position of power actually thought them that few things but, you know
So that's why sometimes internet TV don't work for me, because I can't hear you say something ten minutes after your mouth say it. It ruins it. I don't see how you could do it.
When there is all this clothing just so cheap and so you know.
and how to be the best they could be you know what I am saying
I mean what such an incredible buy there, you know, chocolate-covered almonds with I don't know.
When we were younger, your phone case and your clip, that was a fashion accessory, and it really isn't anymore. Your phone is just your phone. People have kind of moved past that.
you fall out of touch for a while that doesn't mean like, your relationship is done forever I don't know, what do you think?
as the years went on, it would become more and more can you remember when you first started buying things online for yourself?
It's all oil and then you can't. it's all oil and it turns into plastic,
What are your favorite road trips that you've ever taken?
You feel like work is more
even doesn't even have to be your species. It's just a very interesting concept, I think
You know, unique experiences ever in a hotel. Ever in your lifetime
I wanted to ask you since your friend lives in Dubai you went to visit? Did you notice, you said something about the souk. I can't say it, I don't know why?
Cream in your coffee. Yeah well, you gotta figure those sugar also in the cream.
saying all this stuff. Like these are the options like Catholicism says that this is a sin but these are your option.
I think every other way other than that is a worse way. If someone said hey your family is going through a little bit of a crisis okay, don't worry it's nothing that they, it happens to everyone
That's gonna be repeat actors. But I get it. Let's talk about your favourite movie genre.
Yes now you accept payment in your PayPal. You do? You're sure.
you know, it's like fields trip field day, you know field day
where you know you can clean yourself when you go to the washroom in terms of oils and scents and all that stuff, absolutely everybody smelled wonderful, it was just the hygiene and it's awesome.
You see what I hear from all the things that you've been telling me is that you found new communities for yourself.
So, did your friend know that this is what happens in these get-togethers or she was just clueless?
after going out saying you've got to go to school,
As long as some money comes to your account, we don't care where it comes from
fairly known like a fashion type price too, they are really good providing different T-shirt that kind of stuff.
you're gonna have to tag all these cheap clothing coming out of China, because clothing is only second to oil and in carbon footprint.
And I'm curious to know if your friends in Israel were Americans or were they Israelis?
Parents and stuff like that, they're cool? they'll be bothering you
You can successfully do what you need to do like on your own
I think even your PayPal email address.
your mom sends you useless gifts.
but it was weird to have that much time in the late afternoon you know and have your whole workdays.
you never had any parties in your house.
Do you have other favorite movies from this year or from your life?
you gotta have a backbone, you gotta have money. You know what I'm saying you gotta make the money
Movies slash shows on the phone. So I guess watching TV on your phone. I've never watched the TV from my phone. Not like that. No. The only thing I watch on my phone is YouTube videos.
I think from the store's perspective, they must still make a fortune off of cosmetics if they still so.
Yeah, you know what I'm saying. They wanna see you do better, they wanna see you do good. You know what I mean. They they don't wanna see you down. They wanna see you up.
cheers on and do good stuff and be there for everything, you know work, school, religion, jobs everything. The family might be the most sacred thing
But he did and we ended up going and it was a pretty cool experience. I wouldn't say it was just as positive and enchanting as yours was because that sounds like it
Is that your favourite pizza?
To wash your laundry, to do the dishes and stuff, but you don't wanna drink it. So everyone's drinking bottled water.
The movie was awful first of all and then what was funny is my friend always falls asleep in the movie theaters and they have these things at the back of your
No, it's not your brother or yourself, but we would consider your cousin
yeah taking to the zoo you know what I'm saying
So you've got to work a nice balance in between
I always wonder what if your parents watch it? The show like do they, you know.
So that's your figure, that's how much money you are going to make.
Are you sure that it's not something on your end? Maybe?
So, I'm gonna back to the email on January second.  well, that stuff gonna hit your credit card now. I hope so.
after a certain time at night or she won't answer text messages like on Sundays or something like that. So you are like setting boundaries for yourself
I'm doing great. How was your day so far?
No, so is your friend staying there permanently, where do the children staying and how is her relationship with their husband and how are things there because of work or is he closer to his family.
do you think you like your boyfriend's family?
I like them I like having my kids watching a lot of animation stuff with my family and doing all that to dragon balls,
and you're gonna wanna get rid of it anyway and it's just gonna go to the goodwill or to a buffalo exchange if they'll take it and it's not everything is meant to just be replaced
yeah, family will always be there, especially moms and pops, the moms always take care of you
what's yours like?
I think just because, in terms of species, like you said, humans are (developed). Probably looked a little weird. You think your
What's your hope for your kids and stuff like that. If you could take the whole thing. How your parents treated you, your kids. What, how would you do that?
they hate you, they just make up a reason to hate you
Are they willing to take part in that part of your life.
Wow, today you could play with them so they could meet them too
So when I told him about it, he told me about that. And they said I said that is a little insane. somebody brush your teeth.
I see, that's why I say be single and mingle, so you don't have to worry about hurting nobody's feelings and you don't have to worry about getting your feelings hurt
(Well, I remember) I have a question for you. Did you have multiple, the best way to explain is to explain how my town works
That's crazy, you've got
to help save the day and bring the groceries inside the rain. So that was good. You never really have to bring you never have to really save your groceries.
but then it's also nice to be able to introduce your creativity into the lesson, and sometimes there's not enough time because there's so much material.
Do you feel like you learned a lot from your kids and stuff?
How was your senior year in high school. Did you go to senior prom or anything?
Can I get your email, so I can send all information to your email, please?
Did I take you? Or did I take Ethan? Like food, it's like sort of you serve yourself and it's like food by weight
Maybe you're going to some kind of event or restaurant. When you're doing something like that, how much thought do you put into your outfit?
You own your personality that shapes who you are and there's just no guarantee, there's just no textbook that can teach you all these things for sure.
thing to try and bring the price down. Because for Airbnb I don't see too many coupons, like they don't give you your money if I go
No, going back from Budapest, I actually had the opportunity when my grandmother was still alive. She grew up in Budapest.
Why don't you just do it on your phone? You don't like what?
you don't need it, but you buy it all the time, and you know, if you summed up your monthly bills, it would take up a little percentage there?
and I was like, hey do you want to get something off the menu and your looking at the menu. And it took us a while to decide anyway. So we get a beer
