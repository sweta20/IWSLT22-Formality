I think having something run that long would be a neat accomplishment, something that you create to exist long past your time.
I do. I used to play a lot but not any more. Do you play too?
did you throw your order into a wooden trunk?
Wow that is hard to believe although I have been on that ride and it is so much fun. The dinosaurs in Jurassic Park only appear in the film for 15 minutes surprisingly. It was nice talking with you today.
Wow that's impressive! Did you realize that airplanes travel 10% slower these days? They do it to save fuel but you also get to your destination slower
no, not a big gamer, you? The u.s. department of defense used 1760 playstation 3's to build a supercomputer because it was cheaper than the alternative
True but I think cats are smarter than most politicians. Can you see your average House member doing long division?
That is really expensive I agree, did you watch the Lego Batman movie?
you see I liked Force Awakens a lot. I like Kylo Ren. its a different spin because he conflicted and not just all big bad and evil
Honestly, it would hurt to throw a phone as high as you could, and even to attempt to catch it with your hands. Needs some setup. Avoiding hitting yourself in the face.
I listen to it occasionally, but I have a hard time finding really good artists. Do you prefer mainstream hits or smaller artists you find on your own?
I would use a rocket launcher LOL just kidding. do you watch soccer at all? Apparently soccer makes more than all other sports combined
Its either from 2017 or 2018. Netflix has it if you or anyone has access to it.
They're facing a lot of competition these days. What games did you play?
Minerva.  Her name is actually Minerva Mouse.  I think Minnie suits her much better don't you?
I never thought about that. Could you imagine washing your clothes in old faithful?
I didn't until you just told me!  Lego replaced Ferrari as the worlds most powerful brand in 2015.
Yep I agree it seems stupid. I don't know why they need to play on grass specifically, did you hear about the longest tennis point of all time?
The film I felt he really earned an Oscar for was Jerry Maguire. So memorable. Do you agree?
Yeah, that is kind of odd! Well, it's been nice chatting with you, I need to go walk my dog, now.
Have you ever seen Big hero 6?
LOL. Well, it wasn't designed for tourists! I guess you learned your lesson. Still, thanks for helping keep Istanbul clean!
Since Nintendo owns the Mariners there;s even a 3DS app that allows you to order food direct to your seat. That would be awesome!
Did you ever see her "Cribs" episode on MTV? She is super-extra!
Thats a big fail lol, you dont want your product to fail during an important presentation, did you ever play the game Send me to Heaven?
That's a safer translation. Well, I enjoyed chatting with you! Enjoy your Bible study!
I guess the instrument would irritate your face over a long time period. Do you enjoy fantasy by any chance?
Yes they do, tipping your hat origin is from when a knight raises their visors.
Hmm. Do you hunt? Or are the deer protected in your area? There are lots of places that restrict such things.
Yeah that is true. Do you use your phone much?
Yes, your height is great for corner kicks. maybe as a goalie too. Anyway, great chat!
I thought it was great too! It really surprised me that it was so good!  It's also impressive about that super computer don't you think?
That is pretty funny. It must be out of principle because they definitely have the money, only $30,000, I guess they just don't want to support it perhaps? What do you think
What is your favorite mode of travel? The Dutch are currently creating a commuter bus that will travel at 160 mph...
Nice. How I met your mother was underrated. I really like westworld but I can get confused watching it. I watch a lot of live sports too.
That's cool. I like comedy movies and tv shows. Have you ever seen 3rd rock from the sun?
Its all I have to work from we prob have different stuff no biggie. Tell me more about your topic.
Do you listen to music at the gym? Do you bring your own music or listen to what the gym is already playing?
I feel bad for stray dogs sometimes. Istanbul has a vending machine that releases food and water for them if you recycle plastic bottles.
I know, and when you think about it it doesnt take much time just have to incorporate them as habits in your routine.
Good Morning! Do you like to watch horror films?
No, I didn't know that! So I guess your Android might tell Google maps how fast traffic is going on the road. That's how it calculates traffic.
I did not know that. So if comics are not are thing, where to do get your entertainment from?
So says good ol' Factual Section 2. Have you ever had a conversation with your dog over the phone?
WOW, kids now a days love the internet. Netflix has a movie that is nothing but an hour long video of a fireplace - fireplace for your home Adults too, I guess
Wouldn't that be something to see! Have you seen Thor? I tried to watch it but had a hard time following it.
Interesting. If you think about it, a lot of power comes from water.
Yeah that is crazy. He's actually a good actor in my opinion, have you seen the movie the Revenant? I didn't know that it was a remake of a 1971 movie
Good morning, yes I do. How about yourself?
I used to play that too. Did you Tom Hanks brother does woody's voice in video games?
