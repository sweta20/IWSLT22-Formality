Yes, that is very cool. maybe your dogs could be donors. i hope that the dogs at the drives get lots of treats.
True but I think cats are smarter than most politicians. Can you see your average House member doing long division?
It wouldn't guarantee you win the game but it would sure make it a lot easier. Lol. Have a great day.
Yeah that makes sense, did you heard about the $10 million bunker he has?
Yeah, and most places you travel you can still access your account since it's available in countries except for China, Syria, North Korea and Crimea.
I wonder if you get extra credit if you start growing your hair out for that class? lol I had a mythology and fantasy class in college. It was pretty good.
It used to be my nickname!  Not because I am as old as Shakespeare... since he was alive during the time of Pocahontas, which is a little older than I. What's your take on SHakespeare?
lol, I know you have to enjoy it if your trying something new! Doing something different with water is interesting. But, lapping it up like a cat doesn't sound fun.
That is amazing. Have you seen the movie Blazing Saddles?
Yeah, that is pretty interesting. Did you see the Goonies?
I have taken yoga before but I need a few more classes before I get more flexible. It was fun chatting with you, have a great day!

Is the sun blocking your internet signal tonight?
I agree with you! Especially with the box office at what it is. I would hate to work for the movie Trojan Wars. They made only 309 dollars on a budget of 15 million!
Yeah, i understand! people want to carve out there own identity. Jazz is pretty big. you might find something in there to call your own.
No I didn't but I totally agree with you. I guess Dubai is in a desert region so they need a lot of water to keep the grass green but it still seems wrong just to play golf on it.

I agree, so do you like fiction?
You watch movies which is your favourite ?
Yeah, there isn't much else to do in Buffalo except go to the mall! So, since you haven't had a Cadillac, what other cars have you had in your life?
Have you ever played the game yourself, I have not, I'm not originally from the US.
I'm not too bothered by the genre, as long as it makes me laugh. How do you watch your movies, on TV or on a computer?
Might as well take a risk. Lebron is looking good this season. He's so focused. Whose your favorite player?
Yep that is cool LOL. What do you think about Vin Diesel getting a secret script that says what Groot is actually speaking in the movies
that is interesting I always wondered that, do you use google for your searches? or another website?
What's your favorite Batman movie? Mine's The Dark Knight. I heard Smallville was originally going to be about Bruce Wayne becoming Batman. I guess that ended up as Gotham though.
Nice me too! I never heard of that, that would be awesome, do you use your own car or a cart?
I could definitely see that. What were your favorite video games? Jane McGongiai was the game designer behind that study, pretty cool.
